# drawing-tool
Final project for Msc Creative Coding 2. This project uses ReactJS as an interface for a WebGL and WebAssembly-based drawing tool, and Bulma as CSS framework. 


This just a first step in a tool I'd like to build which can design
1) Layout
2) Components
3) Freeform

Credit for a lot of my WebGL learning goes to the following resources:
